"29975","en","Slightly Trickier Sample Survey","<p>This is a <strong><em>sample survey</em></strong> designed for testing LimeSurvey.</p><p>One of the first things you'll need to do, in order to make this work properly, is to fix up the &quot;reference to previous answers&quot; codes in the first two questions of Group 2.  These questions contain (INSERTANS:1X2X3) code that needs the numbers changed to match questions 1 and 3 of Group 1. In order to find this number out, browse to question 1 of Group 1, and then copy the code from the URL bar in your web browser, starting from the number after &quot;SID=&quot;</p><p><strong><em>IE:</em></strong> 29975&amp;gid=2&amp;qid=4</p><p>Then, replace the &quot;&amp;gid=&quot; with an X, and replace the &quot;&amp;qid=&quot; with an X. So you should have:</p><p>29975X2X4</p><p>Then, you can replace the number in the curly brackets of question 1, group 2, so that it says:</p><p>(INSERTANS:29975X2X4)</p><p>Do the same with the other codes in the questions.</p><p>More information on using the answers to previous questions in your questions is available in the documentation.</p>","Welcome to the LimeSurvey Sample Survey","","Invitation to participate in survey","Dear {FIRSTNAME},\n\nYou have been invited to participate in a survey.\n\nThe survey is titled:\n""{SURVEYNAME}""\n\n""{SURVEYDESCRIPTION}""\n\nTo participate, please click on the link below.\n\nSincerely,\n\n{ADMINNAME} ({ADMINEMAIL})\n\n----------------------------------------------\nClick here to do the survey:\n{SURVEYURL}","Reminder to participate in survey","Dear {FIRSTNAME},\n\nRecently we invited you to participate in a survey.\n\nWe note that you have not yet completed the survey, and wish to remind you that the survey is still available should you wish to take part.\n\nThe survey is titled:\n""{SURVEYNAME}""\n\n""{SURVEYDESCRIPTION}""\n\nTo participate, please click on the link below.\n\nSincerely,\n\n{ADMINNAME} ({ADMINEMAIL})\n\n----------------------------------------------\nClick here to do the survey:\n{SURVEYURL}","Survey Registration Confirmation","Dear {FIRSTNAME},\n\nYou, or someone using your email address, have registered to participate in an online survey titled {SURVEYNAME}.\n\nTo complete this survey, click on the following URL:\n\n{SURVEYURL}\n\nIf you have any questions about this survey, or if you did not register to participate and believe this email is in error, please contact {ADMINNAME} at {ADMINEMAIL}.","Confirmation of completed survey","Dear {FIRSTNAME},\n\nThis email is to confirm that you have completed the survey titled {SURVEYNAME} and your response has been saved.
